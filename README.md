# COVID-19-Dashboard
The COVID Dashboard is a data visualization project that utilizes Tableau to analyze and present COVID-19-related data. It is designed to provide insights into the pandemic's spread, vaccination efforts, and socioeconomic impacts.

The Excel files show extracted tables from my previous "COVID-19 Data Exploration Project using SQL" project.
